						Redesigning the CS Office Hours Experience
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="info">
					<div>
						<strong>Duration: </strong>
						8 weeks, Fall 2019
					</div>

					<div>
						<strong>Worked with: </strong>
						Amy Jiang, Angela Lee, Jordan Yee, Yixin Zhang
					</div>

					<div>
						<strong>Role: </strong>
						We interviewed and researched together, then diverged to design our individual solutions, so all designs are my own.
					</div>

					<div>
						<strong>Tools: </strong>
						Adobe XD, User Research, Rapid Prototyping
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="h2">Overview</div>
					<p>
						Office hours provide an <strong> extra resource for college students who need extra help.</strong> Due to the massive number of students in computer science (CS) classes here at UC Berkeley, office hours (OH) implement an online queue system to systematically help students. 
					</p>


				<div class="h2">Problem</div>
					<p>
						However, <strong> CS office hours are notorious for being inefficient and stressful </strong> for not only students, but also the teaching assistants, tutors, and academic interns (students who help facilitate OH).
					</p>

				<div class="h2">Purpose</div>
					<p>
						However, CS office hours are notorious for being inefficient and stressful for not only students, but also the teaching assistants, tutors, and academic interns (students who help facilitate OH).
					<br><br>
						OH allow teaching staff to work with those who need the extra help, which can <strong> make a real difference in conceptual understanding.</strong>
					</p>

				<div class="h2">User Research</div>
					<p>
						We interviewed 3 people each to compile insights, conducted secondary research to identify the specific pain points of OH for both students and instructors. Then diverged to design our individual solutions, so all designs are my own. View the full findings <a href="cs/full.pdf" class="link">here.</a>
					</p>

					<div class="h3">Insights</div>
						<ol>
							<li>The rooms that OH are held in create a <strong>physical limitation</strong> to how many students the staff can help.</li>
							<li> The OH experience <strong>hinges significantly on the availability of course staff </strong> because students are going to them for academic help.</li>
							<li><strong>Piazza provides quicker help,</strong> but it is more difficult to address issues such as debugging or gaining a better conceptual understanding over Piazza than through OH.</li>
							<li>OH is a great place for conceptual learning because students get more personalized one-on-one help.</li>
							<li><strong>The faults with office hours stem from all sides,</strong>not just with its immediate facilitators (course staff).</li>
							<li>OH conditions such as crowdedness and level of helpful staff vary based on time of day, if there is an upcoming deadline, and because of varying experience levels required for staff.</li>
							<li><strong>Course staff have a more positive perception of OH effectiveness,</strong> because they are often more productive than students.</li>
							<li>It is hard to remember that the staff are also college students with their own schedules and limitations because of the tense environment long wait times and deadlines can create.</li>
							<li>The quality of help received during OH depends significantly on the expertise of the course staff giving the help.</li>
							<li><strong>The OH setting is more casual than a traditional classroom</strong> which allows students to open up more and feel more comfortable asking questions.</li>
						</ol>


				<div class="h2">Problem, Redefined</div>
					<p>
						Unfortunately, the CS department does not have the budget to hire enough teaching staff to properly support so many students, and it shows. Rooms are overcrowded with many students sitting on the floor, wait times are long, and help sometimes isn't very helpful. The OH experience is exceptionally bad as a project deadline draws closer. This impacts a student's ability to get help on their work, which can create stress that negatively impacts mental health. So,
						<br><br>

						<strong>How might we improve the office hours experience?</strong>
					</p>

				<div class="h2">Ideation</div>
					<p>
						I set a timer for two minutes and wrote down one idea on a post-it note until time ran out (left side). Then I tried to match each post-it note to each insight and wrote out any additional thoughts I had (right side).

						<p>
							The original (left) and my redesign (right). The Assigned tab felt redundant as students typically only care about when it is almost their turn and not if it is someone else's, so I removed it. I chose a different page layout to better utilize vertical space. This way there can be more Tips and Tricks in addition to seeing more of the Queue, which is important if you don't want to miss your turn. Before, your Queue Ticket would open in another page. By having it save on the right side, I eliminated that unnecessary feature.

						<p> Instructor View: </p>
						<div class="two-pic">

						</div>

						<p>
							The original (left) and my redesign (right). Again, the Assigned tab felt redundant because instructors only care about who they have been assigned to, so I removed it. I used a similar page layout to better utilize vertical space. In addition, I added a Sort By filter to help instructors find requests they could help with easily and efficiently. I took inspiration from online shopping to design the list instructors had to scroll through to pick an question they could help with. Not all instructors understand every homework or project inside and out. Some are more comfortable helping with specific parts or questions and they can use the left side to filter those out. Instructors who know what they are doing can help more efficiently. 
						</p>


				<div class="h2">User Testing + Changes</div>
					<p>
						I talked to more TA’s and graduate student instructors to discuss my Mid-Fi and brainstormed how to actually make the process of selecting students to help more efficiently. Some changes I made following their feedback:
						<br>
						<strong>A Common Mistakes Section</strong>
						Have GSI's post common mistakes seen in previous office hours earlier that week on Piazza to decrease the number of people in OH with the same issues.
						<br>
						<strong>OH Tips and Tricks</strong>
						An advantage of a packed room is that students can interact with their surrounding peers and work on problems together while they wait. This is suggested as a tip for students and to Admin/TA’s to cut down on wait time overall.

				<div class="h2">Closing Thoughts</div>
					<p>
						Something I forgot to consider was what feedback both the instructor and student should receive from the queue. In person, the instructor typically calls for the student within the classroom. But even so, there should be some UI for when the instructor is done and needs to move on to another student.
