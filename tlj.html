				<div class="h2">Context—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Tous les Jours is a bakery & cafe that sells coffee, cakes, and bread.</div>
						<div class="right">
							During my senior year of high school (2018), I worked part-time at Tous les Jours (TLJ) as a barista and cashier.
						 	<br>
						 	<br>
							Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I've missed going to local cafes like TLJ. As a self-proclaimed cafe enthusiast, I decided to design a mobile app for Tous les Jours as a personal project.
							<br>
							<br>
							Note: Any research was based on my experience there, conversations with old coworkers, or what I could find online. Product pictures are from the Tous les Jours <a href="https://www.tljus.com/" class="link" target="_blank">website.</a>
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Problem & Purpose—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Lack of customers results in a decrease in revenue and an increase in food waste.</div>
						<div class="right">
							Past coworkers have told me that <strong>since the pandemic, the bakery has sold less bread and has had days where no customers come in.</strong> Inside seating, which used to be a big draw for customers - primarily for studying & meetings - is no longer permitted.
							<br>
							<br>
							Due to the decrease in business, TLJ is typically unable to sell all breads and pastries made on a given day; the conditions of the pandemic make it less feasible to donate food as well, which contributes to food waste. However, adhering to physical distancing guidelines and protecting both employees and customers is important. Sadly, if the dip continues, the bakery will be forced to close and fire its employees.
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Research—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Previous pain points were worsened by the pandemic.</div>
						<div class="right">
							 <strong>Common issues customers would face:</strong>
							 <ul>
							 	<li>Ordering something we no longer made (our menu was outdated)</li>
							 	<li>Coming in and seeing what they wanted was sold out</li>
							 	<li>During the pandemic, going outside even with a mask can feel risky, which prevents many from going to TLJ</li>
							 </ul>

							 <strong>Main pain points for employees and the business were:</strong>
							 <ul>
							 	<li>No means for digital tips, only a physical tip jar</li>
							 	<li>Food waste from unsold items</li>
							 	<li>During the pandemic the biggest issues are ensuring safety and generating revenue</li>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="h2">Competitor Analysis—</div>
						<div>In order to study what’s currently avaliable in the app market, I looked into the apps of 2 nearby cafe and coffeeshop competitors and found that <strong>competitors' apps have favorable features but do not efficiently display content.</strong></div>
						<img src="tlj/comp.png" style="width:100%; height: 100%; padding-top: 1em">

				<div class="h2">Goals—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Increase safety for both employees and customers.</div>
						<div class="right">
							By meeting these goals below, we are promoting a sense of security among both user groups and consequently creating a better customer experience that together would maintain revenue.
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Pre-Ordering</strong> - By allowing customers to order ahead of time, the amount of time a customer spends in the store is decreased, limiting contact for both customers and employees.</li>

								<li><strong>Reflect Inventory</strong> - Some customers are looking to buy specific things. If out-of-stock items were reflected in the app, customers would not have to make an unnecessary trip. By preventing unnecessary trips, TLJ could prevent customer dissatisfaction too.</li>

								<li><strong>Convenience</strong> - Increased convenience and safety could bring in more customers.</li>
							</ol>					
						</div>
					</div>

				<!--<div class="h2">Design Principles—</div>
					<div>Tous les Jours means "everyday" in French. The website says TLJ promises freshness, quality, and joyful experience. I felt that <strong>the TLJ brand was fresh, innovative, and "there for you."</strong> As an employee, I saw TLJ be a part of birthdays and other celebrations but also a part of daily life as a place high school students meet to do homework after school. </div>

						<div>
							<p><strong>Compact, but easily navigable menu</strong> with pictures to parallel the experience of seeing baked goods in-store and display information more efficiently than competitors.
							<br><br>
							Layout of menus is staggered to make it <strong>easier for people to scan</strong> through using a rigid left-right downward motion.
							<br><br>
							Favorites page for <strong>regulars</strong> who always order the same things.

					<div class="design-decision">
						<img src="tlj/addtobag.png">
						<div>
							<p>Removed bottom dashboard (as seen in previous screen) so <strong> users are focused on the UI for ordering.</strong> 
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Easy access to the cart by swiping up</strong> so users would not have to abandon this order to navigate to their cart, increasing chances of sale.
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Option to choose iced/hot</strong> because in real life, often people would order their drinks without specifying iced/hot and we'd have to ask for clarification.</p>
						</div>

					<div class="design-decision">
						<img src="tlj/checkout.png">

					<div class="design-decision">
						<img src="tlj/home2.png">
						<div>
								<p> Made clear <strong>how long an order is taking</strong> and where to <strong>view your order</strong>.

								To make sure users notice, I would design an animation showing where you can view your most recent order once you exited the order confirmation.</p>

				<div class="h2">REFLECTIONS—</div>
				<div class="section">
					<div class="callout">Designing with both the business and customers in mind.</div>
					<div class="right">
						In the begining I designed mostly with the customer in mind, considering how they might categorize the typical items a bakery would sell, what type of layout would be the most intuitive to use, and paralleling the real life ordering experience.
						<br><br>
						But a main goal of mine for this sprint was to create a way to help TLJ generate enough business to survive through the pandemic. This required me to approach my screens from a business standpoint as well. Features like Favorites to make ordering faster and design decisions to prevent user errors encourages more sales.
						<br><br>
						I think in many ways both a business and customer approach compliment each other because a happy customer can mean more revenue, but in a future iteration I would like to consider how a rewards program, for example, fits into the business model. Something I think I could've put more consideration into this time around would be clear directions for curbside pickup/takeout to further ensure safety during the pandemic and laying down a strong foundation so the app could still be valuable in a post-pandemic world. 
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="h2">FOR THE NEXT ITERATION—</div>
				<div class="section">
					<div>Additional features I would like to include with more time:
					<ul>
						<li>Contextual actions within the cart (adjusting quantity, deleting, favoriting?) — to improve ux</li>
						<li>Option to add a tip — considering secondary users</li>
						<li>Option to input how you would like your order to be packed — to improve ux and possibly, encourage sustainability</li>
						<li>Consider business side of this app (for employees and TLJ) — considering secondary users</li>
						<li>An integrated rewards program experience — to improve ux and possibly encourage sales</li> 
					</ul>
