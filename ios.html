				<div class="h2">Problem‚Äî</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Smartphone usage harms our mannerisms and the quality of our in-person social interactions.</div>
						<div class="right">
						In the US, at least 3 out of 4 people now own a smartphone. As smartphone capabilities continue to grow, many people rely on their smartphones for almost everything. While smartphones keep us connected virtually, research suggests that smartphone usage actually harms our mannerisms and the quality of our in-person social interactions. 
						<br>
						<br>
						How might we encourage better social habits when it comes to smartphones?
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Purpose‚Äî</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Phone usage tragically steals individuals‚Äô ability to fully engaging in the present moment.</div>
						<div class="right">
							Research has shown that smartphone usage leads to less participation in social activities, undermining the value of social interactions. Another study showed phone use is associated with less positive social impressions, lower interaction quality with friends and lower relationship satisfaction with a romantic partner.
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">User Research‚Äî</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Conversation is the most human thing we do. Phone usage changes that.</div>
						<div class="right">
						I interviewed 10-15 of my peers on their phone usage. If possible, I scheduled a coffee chat and asked my questions after I caught them going on their phone in the middle of our conversation. In addition, as a Cognitive Science major, I wanted to read the literature and see what I could learn from social experiments already conducted on this topic. 
					<br>
					<br>
						If you would like to see my research, how I got these insights, and what I did with them in-depth, here's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iDfW4hJ-l5iYRW-8As_Zl1of8EjHzv_Bd19lQNCDQ34/edit?usp=sharing" class="link" target="_blank">slide deck</a> (This was super fun to research üòÖ).

						<div class="h3">Insights‚Äî</div>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Humans are social beings.</strong></li>
							<li> Just having a phone present during a conversation <strong>‚Üì the quality of the empathic connection</strong> people feel and of the conversation because we will anticipate notifications interrupting us.</li>
							<li>Notifications and app content are <strong>made to be addictive.</strong></li>
							<li>People don‚Äôt care about EVERY notification.</li>
							<li><strong>Humans suck at multitasking.</strong>That‚Äôs why notifications get us.</li>
						</ol>
						</div>
					</div>

					


				<div class="h2">Problem, Redefined‚Äî</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Phones don‚Äôt give us an out.</div>
						<div class="right">
						As we have adapted to technology, we have also developed addictions and antisocial habits but technology doesn‚Äôt give us an out. We have classically conditioned ourselves and associate phone vibrations with excitement, value, social interaction, etc. Another way notifications get us is since humans prefer warmer colors so red notification bubbles sufficiently caputres our attention. Refreshing apps is comparable to gambling at a slot machine. This and more has led to phones devaluing social interactions by being a distraction.
						<br><br>

						*Note: due to the time limitation of this challenge, I will be focusing only on the role notifications play in terms of these subliminal behavioral changes, however I recognize that there may be other causes to this complex issue.

						<div class="h2">Goals‚Äî</div>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>User Goal</strong> ‚Äî Regain control over notifications.
								<li><strong>Design Goal</strong> ‚Äî Make it easy to tailor how you receive notifications.
								<li><strong>Product Goal</strong> ‚Äî Promote healthier relationship with product.
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

				

				<div class="h2">Ideation‚Äî</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">So, how might we...</div>
						<div class="right">
					
							<ol>
								<li>make the perceived value of social interaction greater than the perceived value of checking your phone?</li>
								<li>provide a chance to reclaim the ability to engage with the present moment which is lost to digital activity (checking your notifications, browsing an app, etc.)?</li>
								<li>discourage negative social habits in order to promote positive ones</li>
							</ol>
					
						
						Instead of going for as many ideas as I could, I wanted something feasible and thought out based on my research since this ‚Äúsolution‚Äù has the power to impact a large audience‚Äôs behavior.
						<br><br>
						I broke down these HMW‚Äôs to help with ideation. I narrowed down my ideas using additional techniques shown in the following pictures.

				<div class="h2">Solution‚Äî</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Improve smartphone notification settings to customize notification preferences.</div>
						<div class="right">
						*Note: I focused on iOS because it turned out Android settings had already had some of the functionalities I wanted to incorporate.
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="h3">High Fidelity Mockups‚Äî</div>
						<div class="section">
							<div class="callout">Customize appearance, time frequency, and type of notifications.</div>
							<div class="right">
							I made these in Adobe XD following and using UI components from Apple's Design System.
							</div>
						</div>
					<br>
					<br>

						<div class="design-decision">
							<img src="ios/final1.png">
							<div class="right">
								The Settings Screen at the time of this challenge, no changes made by me. Other screens made with the iOS Design System.
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="design-decision">
							<img src="ios/final2.png">
							<div class="right">
								<strong>Made the visual of app notifications more customizable.</strong> Also added the option to receive notifications in batches. Both features have shown to be less addictive.
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="design-decision">
							<img src="ios/final3.png">
							<div class="right">
								Added a ‚ÄúTotal Time Spent‚Äù feature so you can receive a pop-up <strong>(visual cue)</strong> letting you know when to stop scrolling.
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="design-decision">
							<img src="ios/final4.png">
							<div class="right">
								<strong>Adapted the existing Do Not Disturb functionality</strong> so that you can allow certain app notifications as exceptions. The default are ‚Äúpeople-only‚Äù apps like email, text, calls, etc.
							</div>
						</div>


				<div class="h2">Closing Thoughts‚Äî</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">This challenge has definitely made me more conscious about my phone habits.</div>
						<div class="right">
						Given the nature of my solution, it would be difficult to user test without having a working prototype to <strong>see how the new notification settings affect users over time.</strong> However, if I had the ability, I would‚Äôve loved to since, during the research phase, many people I interviewed said they often did not realize they were instinctively going on their phones unless it was pointed out. <strong>I am also curious about how this idea would fit into Apple‚Äôs business model and whether they could coexist, so for now, this is my recommendation for Apple based on my research.</strong>
