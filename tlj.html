				<div class="h2">Context—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Tous les Jours is a bakery/cafe that sells coffee, cakes, and bread.</div>
						<div class="right">
							During my senior year of high school, I worked part-time at a local bakery/cafe, Tous les Jours. I was a barista and cashier there for over a year cumulatively.
						 	<br>
						 	<br>
							Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I've missed going to local cafes. As a self-proclaimed cafe enthusiast, I decided to design a mobile app for Tous les Jours as a personal project.
							<br>
							<br>
							Note: I have not worked there since 2019 and this is just for fun. Any research was based on my experience there or what I could find online. Pictures are from the Tous les Jours <a href="https://www.tljus.com/" class="link" target="_blank">website.</a>
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Problem—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">The COVID-19 Pandemic has affected many local businesses in my area.</div>
						<div class="right">
							I still keep in touch with my coworkers who have told me that the bakery sells less bread and has had days where no customers came in. In addition, it is not safe to sit inside the cafe at the tables, which used to be a popular study & meeting spot.
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Purpose—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">The lack of customers results in not only a decrease in revenue, but also an increase in food waste.</div>
						<div class="right">
							 Without enough business, the bakery would be forced to close and fire its employees. Futhermore, TLJ would not be able to sell the bread or pasteries made that day. The conditions of the pandemic make it less feasible to donate food as well, which would contribute to food waste.
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Research—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Competitors' apps have more features but do not efficiently display content.</div>
						<div class="right">
							 Competitor Analysis graphic coming soon!
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Goals—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Increase safety for both employees and customers.</div>
						<div class="right">
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Pre-Ordering</strong> - By allowing customers to order ahead of time, the amount of time a customer spends in the store is decreased, limiting contact for both customers and employees.</li>

								<li><strong>Reflect Inventory</strong> - Some customers are looking to buy specific things. If out-of-stock items were reflected in the app, and a customer could see them, customers would not have to make an unnecessary trip just to find the thing they wanted was out-of-stock.</li>

								<li><strong>Convenience</strong> - Increased convenience and safety could bring in more customers.</li>
							</ol>

				<div class="h2">Final Mockups + Design Decisions—</div>
					<br>
					<img src="tlj/hero2.png" style="width:100%; height: 100%">
					<br>

					<div class="design-decision">
						<img src="tlj/home1.png">
						<p><strong>Home</strong> - TLJ sells drinks (coffees and smoothes), cakes (piece cakes and full-sized), bread+pastries, and also sandwiches. I wanted to display the menu in a compact, but easily navigable way. I also wanted to include pictures, which parallels the experience of seeing the baked goods in-store.
						<br><br>
						Any customer service worker in the food industry knows the regulars always order the same thing, so I included a favorites page. The layout of the menus is staggered to make it easier for people to scan through using a left-right downward motion.
						<br><br>
						Fun fact: I didn't realize the TLJ website had photos so I had originally illustrated some drinks (see section above).</p>
					</div>

					<div class="design-decision">
						<img src="tlj/addtobag.png">
						<p><strong>Ordering</strong> - In order to ensure the ordering process was convenient, I didn't keep the bottom dashboard. This way users are more focused on the UI for ordering. There is also easy access to the cart by swiping up so users would not have to abandon this order, go back to home, and tap on the cart icon. See the Figma prototype below if you'd like to try it!</p>
					</div>

					<div class="design-decision">
						<img src="tlj/checkout.png">
						<p><strong>Order Confirmation</strong> -  I wanted to make sure all crucial information was presented on this confirmation such as what was ordered, prices, payment method used, and time until order is ready. Note: my friend pointed out that I forgot tax. Soemthing this remineded me off was, at TLJ we had no way of receiving digital tips in-store. In my next iteration I would add a place for tips before checkout.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="design-decision">
						<img src="tlj/home2.png">
						<p><strong>Order Access</strong> - A common complaint about mobile ordering apps is not being able to check on your order after you submit it. To rememdy this, once you exited the order confirmation, there would be an animation showing you it has shrinked to the top of the home page.</p>
					</div>


					<div class="h3">Prototype—</div>
						<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); width: 100%; height: 800;" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F3oROQGGvVnMZgM4zx5mQNt%2Ftlj-app%3Fnode-id%3D4%253A25%26scaling%3Dscale-down&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe>

				<div class="h2">REFLECTIONS—</div>
				<div class="section">
					<div class="callout">Local businesses have lasting impacts.</div>
					<div class="right">
						Cafes are interesting to me because I appreciate how they are usually places where people gather. Coffeehouses in the 18th century were places for debate and conversation. But actually working at one impacted me more than I would've thought. I learned a lot from my time in customer service . I've seen TLJ be apart of people's birthdays and other celebrations. It's a place where high school students meet to do homework after school. The pandemic has made me realize that the impact of local businesses goes unappreciated.
						<br><br>
						Additional features I would like to include: Contextual actions within the cart, option to add a tip, option to input how you would like your order to be packed, and a rewards program.
						<br><br>
						Currently, TLJ uses Five Stars so it would be nice to either integrate Five Stars or integrate a rewards program into the app like 85C Bakery. I also have not mocked up the flow for changing location or ordering full-sized cakes (which is usually done over the phone or in-person).
