				<div class="h2">Context—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Tous les Jours is a bakery & cafe that sells coffee, cakes, and bread.</div>
						<div class="right">
							During my senior year of high school (2018), I worked part-time at a local bakery & cafe, Tous les Jours. I was a barista and cashier there for over a year cumulatively.
						 	<br>
						 	<br>
							Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I've missed going to local cafes like TLJ. As a self-proclaimed cafe enthusiast, I decided to design a mobile app for Tous les Jours as a personal project.
							<br>
							<br>
							Note: Any research was based on my experience there, conversations with old coworkers, or what I could find online. Product pictures are from the Tous les Jours <a href="https://www.tljus.com/" class="link" target="_blank">website.</a>
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Problem & Purpose—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Lack of customers results in a decrease in revenue and an increase in food waste.</div>
						<div class="right">
							I still keep in touch with old coworkers who have told me that <strong>since the pandemic, the bakery sells less bread and has had days where no customers came in.</strong> In addition, sitting inside the cafe at the tables, which used to be a popular study & meeting spot, is no longer permitted.
							<br>
							<br>
							 Without enough business, the bakery would be forced to close and fire its employees. Futhermore, TLJ would not be able to sell the bread or pasteries made that day. The conditions of the pandemic make it less feasible to donate food as well, which would contribute to food waste. <strong>However, adhering to physical distancing guidelines and protecting both employees and customer is important.</strong>
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Research—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">The best user research is actually servering users.</div>
						<div class="right">
							 During my time working at the bakery common issues customers would face would be ordering something we no longer made (our menu was outdated back then) and coming in and seeing what they wanted was sold out. During the pandemic, going outside even with a mask can feel risky, which prevents many from going to TLJ.
							 <br><br>
							 Main pain points for employees were lack of digital tip and food waste from unsold bread. During the pandemic the biggest issue was ensuring safety. 
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="h3">Competitor Analysis—</div>
						<div>In order to study what’s currently avaliable in the app market, I looked into the apps of 2 nearby cafe and coffeeshop competitors. <strong>Competitors' apps have favorable features but do not efficiently display content.</strong></div>
						<img src="tlj/comp.png" style="width:100%; height: 100%; padding-top: 1em">

				<div class="h2">Goals—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Increase safety for employees and customers to maintain revenue.</div>
						<div class="right">
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Pre-Ordering</strong> - By allowing customers to order ahead of time, the amount of time a customer spends in the store is decreased, limiting contact for both customers and employees.</li>

								<li><strong>Reflect Inventory</strong> - Some customers are looking to buy specific things. If out-of-stock items were reflected in the app, and a customer could see them, customers would not have to make an unnecessary trip just to find the thing they wanted was out-of-stock.</li>

								<li><strong>Convenience</strong> - Increased convenience and safety could bring in more customers.</li>
							</ol>					
						</div>
					</div>

				<!--<div class="h2">Design Principles—</div>
					<div>Tous les Jours means "everyday" in French. The website says TLJ promises freshness, quality, and joyful experience. I felt that <strong>the TLJ brand was fresh, innovative, and "there for you."</strong> As an employee, I saw TLJ be a part of birthdays and other celebrations but also a part of daily life as a place high school students meet to do homework after school. </div>

					<div class="design-decision">
						<img src="tlj/home1.png">
						<div>
							<div class="h2">Home - </div>
							<p><strong>Compact, but easily navigable menu</strong> with pictures to parallels the experience of seeing the baked goods in-store.
							<br><br>
							The layout of the menus is staggered to make it <strong>easier for people to scan</strong> through using a rigid left-right downward motion.
							<br><br>
							Favorites page for <strong>regulars</strong> always order the same things.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="design-decision">
						<img src="tlj/addtobag.png">
						<div>
							<div class="h2">Ordering - </div>
							<p>Removed bottom dashboard so <strong> users are more focused on the UI for ordering.</strong> 
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Easy access to the cart</strong> by swiping up so users would not have to abandon this order, go back to home, and tap on the cart icon.
							<br>
							<br>
							Option to choose iced/hot because in real life, often people would order without specifying hot/iced and we'd have to ask for clarification.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="design-decision">
						<img src="tlj/checkout.png">
						<div>
							<div class="h2">Checkout - </div>
							<p>Present <strong>all crucial information</strong> on this confirmation such as what was ordered, prices, payment method used, and time until pickup.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="design-decision">
						<img src="tlj/home2.png">
						<div>
							<div class="h2">Order Access - </div>
								<p> A common complaint about mobile ordering apps is not being able to check on your order after you submit it.
								<br>
								<br>
								To rememdy this, once you exited the order confirmation, there would be an <strong>animation</strong> showing you it has shrunk to the top of the home page.</p>

				<div class="h2">REFLECTIONS—</div>
				<div class="section">
					<div class="callout">Local small businesses have large impacts.</div>
					<div class="right">
						The pandemic has made me realize that the impact of local businesses goes unappreciated. Cafes are especially interesting to me because in the 18th century, coffeehouses were places for debate and conversation and stayed places where people gather. It's something I didn't appreciate enough until it was gone. 
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="h3">FOR THE NEXT ITERATION—</div>
				<div class="section">
					<div>Additional features I would like to eventually include:
					<ul>
						<li>Contextual actions within the cart (adjusting quantity, deleting, favoriting?) — to improve ux</li>
						<li>Option to add a tip — meets another employee need</li>
						<li>Option to input how you would like your order to be packed — to improve ux</li>
						<li>Consider business side of this app for employees — considering all users</li>
						<li>An integrated rewards program experience — to improve ux</li> 
					</ul>
