						Reimagining Notifications
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="info">
					<div>
						<strong>Duration: </strong>
						2 weeks, Spring 2020
					</div>

					<div>
						<strong>Worked with: </strong>
						Solo Personal Sprint
					</div>

					<div>
						<strong>Tools: </strong>
						Adobe XD, User Research, Rapid Prototyping
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="h2">Problem</div>
					<p>
						In the US, at least 3 out of 4 people now own a smartphone. As smartphone capabilities continue to grow, many people rely on their smartphones for almost everything. While smartphones keep us connected virtually, research suggests that smartphone usage actually harms our mannerisms and the quality of our in-person social interactions. 
					<br><br>
						<strong> How might we encourage better social habits when it comes to smartphones? </strong>
					</p>

				<div class="h2">Purpose</div>
					<p>
						Research has shown that smartphone usage leads to less participation in social activities, <strong>undermining the value of social interactions.</strong> Another study showed phone use is associated with less positive social impressions, lower interaction quality with friends and lower relationship satisfaction with a romantic partner.
					<br><br>
						Thus, <strong>phone usage tragically steals individuals’ ability to fully engaging in the present moment</strong> which results in anti-social habits.
					</p>

				<div class="h2">User Research</div>
					<p>
						I interviewed 10-15 of my peers on their phone usage. If possible, I scheduled a coffee chat and asked my questions after I caught them going on their phone in the middle of our conversation. In addition, as a Cognitive Science major, I wanted to read the literature and see what I could learn from social experiments already conducted on this topic.
					</p>

					<div class="h3">Insights</div>
						<ol>
							<li>Humans are social beings. <strong>Conversation is the most human thing we can do.</strong></li>
							<li> Just having a phone present during a conversation <strong>↓ the quality of the empathic connection</strong> people feel and of the conversation because we will anticipate notifications interrupting us.</li>
							<li>Notifications and app content are <strong>made to be addictive.</strong></li>
							<li>People don’t care about EVERY notification.</li>
							<li><strong>Humans suck at multitasking.</strong>That’s why notifications get us.</li>
						</ol>


				<div class="h2">Problem, Redefined</div>
					<p>
						As we have adapted to technology, we have also developed addictions and antisocial habits but <strong>technology doesn’t give us an out.</strong> This has led to phones devaluing social interactions by being a distraction.
						<br><br>

						*Note: due to the time limitation of this challenge, I will be focusing only on the role notifications play in terms of these subliminal behavioral changes, however I recognize that there may be other causes to this complex issue.
					</p>

				<div class="h2">Goals</div>
					<ol>
						<li>HMW make the perceived value of social interaction greater than the perceived value of checking your phone?</li>
						<li>HMW provide a chance to reclaim the ability to engage with the present moment which is lost to digital activity (checking your notifications, browsing an app, etc.)?</li>
						<li>HMW discourage negative social habits in order to promote positive ones</li>
					</ol>

				<div class="h2">Ideation</div>
					<p>
						Instead of going for as many ideas as I could, I wanted something feasible and thought out based on my research since this “solution” has the power to impact a large audience’s behavior.
						<br><br>
						I broke down these HMW’s to help with ideation. I narrowed down my ideas using additional techniques shown in the following pictures.
					</p>

					<div class="ios-img">
						<img src="ios/ideation2.png" style="width:100%">
						<img src="ios/ideation3.png" style="width:100%">
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Solution</div>
					<p>
						The idea I settled on was improving smartphone notification settings and allowing user to customize their notification preferences more.
						<br><br>
						*Note: I focused on iOS because it turned out Android settings had already had some of the functionalities I wanted to incorporate.
					</p>

					<div class="h3">Sketches</div>
					<br>
					<div class="ios-img">
						<img src="ios/solution1.jpg" style="width:100%">
						<img src="ios/solution2.jpg" style="width:100%">
					</div>

					<div class="h3">High Fidelity Mockups + Design Decisions</div>
						<p> 
							I made these in Adobe XD following and using UI components from Apple's Design System.
						</p>
						<br>

						<div class="design-decision">
							<img src="ios/final1.png">
							<p>
								The Settings Screen at the time of this challenge, no changes made by me. Other screens made with the iOS Design System
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="design-decision">
							<img src="ios/final2.png">
							<p>
								<strong>Made the visual of app notifications more customizable.</strong> Also added the option to receive notifications in batches. Both features have shown to be less addictive.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="design-decision">
							<img src="ios/final3.png">
							<p>
								Added a “Total Time Spent” feature so you can receive a pop-up <strong>(visual cue)</strong> letting you know when to stop scrolling.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="design-decision">
							<img src="ios/final4.png">
							<p>
								<strong>Adapted the existing Do Not Disturb functionality</strong> so that you can allow certain app notifications as exceptions. The default are “people-only” apps like email, text, calls, etc.
							</p>
						</div>


				<div class="h2">Closing Thoughts</div>
					<p>
						Given the nature of my solution, it would be difficult to user test without having a working prototype to <strong>see how the new notification settings affect users over time.</strong> However, if I had the ability, I would’ve loved to since, during the research phase, many people I interviewed said they often did not realize they were instinctively going on their phones unless it was pointed out. <strong>I am also curious about how this idea would fit into Apple’s business model and whether they could coexist, so for now, this is my recommendation for Apple based on my research.</strong>
