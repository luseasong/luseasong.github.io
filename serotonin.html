							Serotonin / Seeking Long-term Mental Health Care
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="info">
						<div>
							<strong>Duration: </strong>

						</div>

						<div>

							Emily Hom, Yvonne Sun, Jolana Chan, Ivan Miranda
						</div>

						<div>
							<strong>Role: </strong>
							We interviewed and researched together. I contributed to our final board and also the slide deck design/overall brand.
						</div>

						<div>
							<strong>Tools: </strong>
							Adobe Illustration, User Research, Product Thinking

				<div class="h2">Problem—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">The process of finding long term mental health care outside of Tang is ineffective, long, and impersonal.</div>
						<div class="right">
							The University Health Services, also known as the <strong>Tang Center</strong>, is supposed to provide comprehensive medical, mental health, insurance, and health promotion services to students.
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Purpose + Goals—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Mental health and stress management is a huge concern at UC Berkeley.</div>
						<div class="right">
							Life is hard. College is a time that presents numerous obstacles such as difficult classes, financial struggles, among other personal issues. Students should be able to get a college education without a resulting mental illness or decreasing their well-being.
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">User Research—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Many interviewees discussed the process of getting long-term care</div>
						<div class="right">
							We were originally given the broad problem space of <strong>mental health + stress + sleep.</strong> Each of us interviewed two people to investigate and narrow down our issue since all 3 are very interconnected. We realized that many interviewees discussed the process of getting long-term care as a response to our questions. I tried to go through the process myself as someone who had no experience at all with Tang.
						</div>
					</div>

						From there, we also interviewed Tang professionals who told us:

				<div class="h2">Problem, Redefined—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">So, how might we help students feel like they are getting personalized care?</div>
						
						<div class="right">
							The process to begin with posed challenges to those seeking mental health care, but coupled with the impersonality, made students feel more alone and want to quit searching.
							<div class="h3">Insights—</div>
								<ol>
									<li>Students seek help from their communities because they <strong>want to speak with someone they’re comfortable with and who will relate to their struggle.</strong></li>
									<li> Students don’t want to match with a random therapist because they <strong>feel that their problems are unique.</strong></li>
									<li>Students who feel Tang offers insufficient support are discouraged from finding an outside therapist by the <strong>long and complicated process.</strong></li>
								</ol>
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Ideation—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">How would your mom solve this problem?</div>
						<div class="right">
							We used a lot of post-it notes to write down ideas based on different prompts (ie: how would your mom solve this problem?)
						</div>
					</div>

					<br>
					<img src="serotonin/ideation1.png" style="width:100%; height:auto;">

				<div class="h2">Solution—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">serotonin is a non-profit organization that would handle the process.</div>
						
						<div class="right">
							Our solution was a non-profit organization called serotonin to improve the process of seeking long-term care through the university healthcare system. <strong>serotonin's mission is to help students feel like they’re getting personalized care.</strong>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="h3">The New Process (v1)—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">A clear starting point and purposeful survey.</div>
						<div class="right">
							<ol>
								<li> <strong>Stating where to start</strong> — the Tang Center is always advertised but there is little information on where to actually start (online? phone? in person?)</li>
								<li> <strong> A survey </strong> that automatically filters based on your preferences (gender, background, therapy style, specialties) — so no one has to go through 270 options by themselves. </li>
								<li> <strong>A personal care kit</strong> — sent to your mailbox after you schedule your meet and greet! Contains personalized items to help and serves to remind you of your upcoming appointment. </li>
								<li> <strong>Meet and greet</strong> — A way to get to know a therapist and see if they’re a good fit quickly. Group option (you+others meet one therapist) available if preferred. </li>
								<li> <strong>Trial + Rating System</strong> for feedback — Have a free session on us! Let us know how it went! The Rating System is how we’d measure the success of Serotonin. </li>
							</ol>

						The personal care kit prototype. We would include items that help reduce anxiety like coloring books or origami as well as provide more information about other resources at Tang.
					</p>
					

					<div class="h2">User Testing + Feedback—</div>
						<div class="section">
							<div class="callout">Listening to the professionals.</div>
							<div class="right"> 
								We took our prototype to a Tang professional. She gave us very valuable feedback and informed us about some legality issues with our idea. According to her, ethically a patient is only allowed to see one therapist at a time and in fact seeing more than one can be overwhelming for the patient.

								<div class="h3">Changes Based on Feedback</div>
									<ul>
										<li>Simplified the starting point even further. Every part of this process can be found at <strong>one, clear website.</strong></li>
										<li>Our users were confused at Step 2 by the 3 icons, so we reduced it down to 1 and <strong>renamed it to be more informing.</strong></li>
										<li>Step 4 has become a <strong>1-on-1 trial</strong> given what the Tang Center professional told us.</li>
										<li>Every step will be <strong>automated</strong> to ensure no deterrents.</li>
										<li>Users will be able to find their Manageable List online and in their email. Appointments will be automatically scheduled by asking for both parties availabilities. Reminders will also be sent.</li>
									</ul>

				<div class="h2">Business Model—</div>
					<p>
						This was our semester-long project for UGBA 190D: Design Innovation in Business. In addition to using product thinking, part of our project was a business model for Serotonin.
