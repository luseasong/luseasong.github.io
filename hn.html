				<div class="h2">Context—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">hack:now is an online hackathon for fostering solutions to challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.</div>
						<div class="right">
							Hosted by Cal Hacks, the organizers of the world's largest colliegate hackathon, <strong>hack:now is a hackathon focused on tackling some of the most immediate problems we’re facing today.</strong> 2020 so far has been very eventful. Especially with the pandemic, it’s easy to feel like there’s little that just one individual can contribute, but that’s simply not true.
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Purpose—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">When brainstorming hackathon names, I realized that there may not be a better time to hack than... now.</div>
						<div class="right">
							Inspired by how current events shapes lives of society, we wanted to organize a hackathon for the student community to come up with solutions to current issues. Hosting it online not only meant adhering to social distancing standards but also making it more accessible to anyone, anywhere.
							<br>
							<br>
							As the coronavirus continues to affect people in a variety of ways, ranging from health to communication to productivity, <strong>we wanted to leverage our reach. </strong>
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Problem—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">hack:now needed an identity that matched the purpose and goals of the hackathon.</div>
						<div class="right">
							hack:now is about meaningfully building solutions that make definite impact and we hope each iteration brings and unites people together during the times where we need to the most. Some key concepts the brand had to encompass:
							<strong><ol>
								<li>Humanity/Empathy</li>
								<li>Collaboration</li>
								<li>Community</li>
							</ol></strong>
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">Moodboard—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Envisioning collaboration and something "human."</div>
						<div class="right">
							Based on the values hack:now stood for, innovation and collaboration, I put together a moodboard to convey what I had in mind and worked with my design team on fonts and color scheme.
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="h2">First Try—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">hack:now's brand should feel more serious.</div>
						<div class="right">
							This concept was fun and friendly, but the elements that made it so also made it seem childish, which did not along with the seriousneness that comes with tackling current events.
						</div>
					</div>

					<br>
					<img src="hn/one.png" style="width:100%; height:auto;">

				<div class="h2">Second Try—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">Focus less on the news, more on the people.</div>
						
						<div class="right">
							This explored a "newspaper" theme since hack:now is about current events, but we felt like it lacked a friendly vibe. 
						</div>
					</div>

					<br>
					<img src="hn/two.png" style="width:100%; height:auto;">

				<div class="h2">Final Try—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">The design of the website had to be attention grabbing and informative.</div>
						<div class="right">
							This website served as a place for people to go to for information and to eventually sign up! Below is the visual design we decided to go with.
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="h3">The Website—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">You can visit and explore the whole thing <a href="https://hacknow.calhacks.io/" class="link" target="_blank">here!</a></div>
						<div class="right">The Design Team and I spent time working on the mobile version of the <a href="https://hacknow.calhacks.io/" class="link" target="_blank">website</a> too!

				</div>


				<div class="h2">Reflections—</div>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="callout">hack:now shows how far collaboration + teamwork can go!</div>
						<div class="right">
							Fun fact: I’ve actually never participated in a hackathon (I’ve done designathons and other similar events) but I’m extremely passionate about collaboration + teamwork and hack:now just proves how far that can go in not just organizing an event but also what that event can lead to! On the design-end we ran into issues with mobil compatibility and also had to restructure the website in 24hrs to improve conversion but in the end, we brought together 2,500+ hackers, 25+ sponsors, 90+ judges and 80+ judges all to create 225+ hacks!
